## Overview

Detect when a GitHub repository was archived. Archiving a repository makes it read-only and may indicate a deprecation, a transition to maintenance mode, or an effort to preserve historical data. Monitoring these events ensures visibility into repository lifecycle decisions and potential impacts on development workflows.
