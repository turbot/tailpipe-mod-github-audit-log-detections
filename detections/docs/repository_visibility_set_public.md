## Overview

Detect when a private repository's visibility was set to public. Changing a repository to public may expose proprietary or sensitive code, increasing the risk of data leaks, unauthorized access, and potential exploitation. Monitoring these events ensures that repository visibility changes are intentional and comply with security policies.
