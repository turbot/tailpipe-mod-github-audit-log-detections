## Overview

Detect when an organization's moderator was removed. Removing a moderator may reduce oversight and weaken security controls, potentially impacting the organization's ability to manage discussions, enforce policies, and monitor repository activity. Monitoring these events ensures that privilege revocations are intentional and align with security policies.
