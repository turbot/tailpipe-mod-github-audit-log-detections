Detect when a GitHub fine-grained personal access token (PAT) was granted access to resources. Personal access tokens grant access to repositories, actions, or APIs, and unauthorized token creation can lead to credential leaks or compromised accounts. Monitoring these events helps ensure secure access management and compliance with security policies.
