## Overview

Detect when an OAuth application authorization was revoked in a GitHub organization. Revoking an OAuth application's authorization may indicate security control enforcement, access revocation due to risk concerns, or an unintended misconfiguration. Monitoring these revocations helps ensure proper access management and prevents unauthorized data exposure.
