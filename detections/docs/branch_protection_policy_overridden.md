## Overview

Detect when a branch protection policy was overridden in a GitHub repository. Overriding branch protection policies may allow unauthorized changes, force pushes, or unverified commits, which can compromise repository integrity and introduce security risks. Monitoring these events helps enforce code security standards and detect potential misuse of administrative privileges.
