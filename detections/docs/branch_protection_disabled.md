## Overview

Detect when branch protection was disabled in a GitHub repository. Disabling branch protection may expose the repository to unauthorized changes, force pushes, or unreviewed commits, increasing the risk of code tampering and security vulnerabilities. Monitoring these events helps maintain repository security and enforce development best practices.
